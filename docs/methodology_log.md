**Subject:** Foundational Methodology for AI-Driven Literature Review

Traditional Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to error, particularly in rapidly evolving research fields[cite: 968, 2733]. Recent studies highlight significant gaps in the automation of critical phases such as data extraction, quality assessment, and data synthesis[cite: 2709, 2944, 3001, 3006]. To address these challenges, this study adopts a semi-automated pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enhance the efficiency and rigor of the review process[cite: 182, 969].
Our approach is directly informed by recently proposed frameworks like PROMPTHEUS, which demonstrate the feasibility of an end-to-end automated SLR pipeline[cite: 994, 995, 1131]. The methodology consists of three main stages. First, a **systematic search and screening** phase will use an LLM to generate a robust search query and Sentence-BERT embeddings to filter for the most relevant papers based on semantic similarity[cite: 1131, 1142, 1181]. Second, a **data extraction and topic modeling** phase will employ the BERTopic algorithm to cluster the selected literature into coherent themes[cite: 214, 1001, 1202]. This technique leverages UMAP for dimensionality reduction and HDBSCAN for clustering, providing a robust method for thematic analysis[cite: 344, 345, 386]. Finally, we will construct and analyze a **knowledge graph** to map the relationships between concepts, papers, and authors, providing a structural overview of the research landscape[cite: 1717, 2277]. This comprehensive, AI-assisted methodology aims to produce a systematic and data-driven analysis while significantly reducing the manual workload associated with traditional review methods[cite: 970].
