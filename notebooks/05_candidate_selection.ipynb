    "This notebook implements the first phase of the analytical framework: Corpus Characterization and Candidate Selection. The objective is to move from the full corpus of papers to a defensible, balanced subset of approximately 50-75 key papers for in-depth qualitative analysis. This is achieved using a \"Two-Bucket\" strategy to identify both \"Foundational Pillars\" and \"Rising Stars\" in the literature."
